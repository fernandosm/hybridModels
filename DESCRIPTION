Description: Simulates stochastic hybrid models for transmission of infectious
    diseases in dynamic networks. It is a metapopulation model in which each
    node in the network is a sub-population and disease spreads within nodes
    and among them, combining two approaches: stochastic simulation algorithm
    (<doi:10.1146/annurev.physchem.58.032806.104637>) and individual-based
    approach, respectively. Equations that models spread within nodes are
    customizable and there are two link types among nodes: migration and
    influence (commuting). More information in Fernando S. Marques,
