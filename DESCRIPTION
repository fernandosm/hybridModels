Description: Simulates stochastic hybrid models for transmission of infectious
    diseases in dynamic networks. It is a metapopulation model in which each
    node in the network is a sub-population and disease spreads within nodes
    and among them, combining two approaches: stochastic simulation algorithm
    or its approximations (Gillespie DT (2007)
    <doi:10.1146/annurev.physchem.58.032806.104637>) and individual-based
    approach, respectively. Movement among nodes are data based and can be
    irregular. Equations that models spread within nodes are customizable and
    there are two link types among nodes: migration and influence (commuting).
