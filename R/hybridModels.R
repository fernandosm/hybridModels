#' hybridModels: an R package for stochastic simulation of disease spreading in dynamic networks.
#'
#' The hybridModels package provides functions to simulate stochastics models
#' in dynamics networks, using two processes in different scales:
#' 1 Global scale to simulate the transmission from one node to another
#' 2 Local sacale to simulate the transmission inside the node
